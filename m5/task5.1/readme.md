Device types are: Character, Block, Pipe, Socket. First symbols means device type:
c - character
b - block
p - pipe
s - socket

 By printing a list of files with the `ls` command, you can determine the file type. The first character tells us the type, namely:  
 '-' stands for file,   
 'd' for directory,   
 'p' for named pipe,   
 'l' for symbolic,   
 'c' and 'b' for symbolic and block device files,  
 's'- socket,  
 'D'- door
