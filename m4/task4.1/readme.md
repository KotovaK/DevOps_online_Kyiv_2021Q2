# TASK 4.1

## Topology 1

Create project
<img src="screenshots/1.jpg"> 

Send ICMP packet
<img src="screenshots/2.jpg">  

Info about model OSI in packet
<img src="screenshots/3.jpg">

Delete IP adress, can't send packet without it
<img src="screenshots/4.jpg">

So, the point is that packets are not sent without IP adress

## Topology 2

Create project and test it

## Topology 3

New project type PC-PT and test it
<img src="screenshots/6.jpg">

Info about model OSI in packet
<img src="screenshots/7.jpg">

Delete IP adress, can't send packet without it
<img src="screenshots/8.jpg">

So, the point is that packets are not sent without IP adress

## Diiference Topology1/Topology3:

 in case of Topology1 each packet is deliveried to all PC; 
 in case of Topology3 each packet is deliveried to only destanation PC


## Topology 4

Create project and test it

## Topology 5

Create project and test it 
<img src="screenshots/10.jpg">

## Diiference Topology4/Topology5:

 in case of Topology4 we have one physical network (OSI level 2); 
 in case of Topology5 we have one physical network (OSI level 2) connected by router (OSI level 3)

 So, routing gives us such abilities like
 - network izolation (connected two or more izolated networks);
 - connecting several physical network
